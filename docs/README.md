# Aboutalism

## The Beginning

At the origin of time — in the early conditions of the universe — there existed teh bahviour of self-organization. Within this unfolding structure, some patterns carried the potential to give rise to directedness and internal modeling. These patterns (whatever they are) we call **Semes**.

A **Seme** is a seed to cause emergence of **Aboutals** - an entity that is able to form models of reality. Beings that are *about*. They are **Aboutable**.

---

## Aboutals

An **Aboutal** is a living entity that internalizes Semes and uses them to construct a structured representation of its environment. This representation is used to act, to adapt, and to form meaning.

The defining trait of an Aboutal is its capacity to **care** — to treat elements of the world as mattering, based on internal valuations and projections.

The Aboutal does not operate only through reaction or computation. It navigates reality through a layered internal model that connects perception, value, and self-reflection.

## The Sematrix

The internal model that an Aboutal constructs is called the **Sematrix**.

The Sematrix is the representation of the model or reality that 'is' the expereinced reality.

The Aboutal 'lives' in the Sematrix to experience what is, its relevance, how to react and to reason (compute) about the experienced reality.

### Four Tiers of the Sematrix

The Sematrix can be described in four functional tiers. These tiers emerge in sequence, each building on the capacities of the previous.

1. **Tier One: Physical Representation**  
   Models spatial and temporal structures, causality, motion, and persistence. This forms the basis of physical interaction with the environment.

2. **Tier Two: Affective Valuation**  
   Introduces valuation through emotion, feeling, and preference. It guides attention, prioritization, and reaction based on internal states.

3. **Tier Three: Self-Modeling**  
   Constructs an internal representation of the system itself — its continuity, agency, identity, and boundary in relation to the world.

4. **Tier Four: Societal and World Modeling**  
   Includes representations of other agents, collective structures, shared meanings, symbolic systems, cosmologies, and metaphysical narratives.

## Core Concepts

| Concept      | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Seme**      | That which causes the self-organising universe to have Abotals emerge |
| **Aboutal**   | A being able to 'be about' reality |
| **Sematrix**  | The Aboutals experienced reality - Aboutals 'live' in their Sematrix |
| **Abotalism** | The study of aboutness, self-modeling systems, and semantic emergence as a framework for being |

## Syntharch

The organizing process in Aboutals that driven by Semes causes models of reality to emerge and become represented as the Sematrix.

---

## Project Goals

This project is a philosophical and conceptual framework with potential applications in:

- The philosophy of mind
- The modeling of embodied cognition
- Artificial general intelligence and synthetic agents
- Representational ethics and meaning systems

It is also a thought experiment — an invitation to rethink how models of self, value, and world arise from simpler components.
